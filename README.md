## Can Crime Characterics Predict Full Moons?
* Exert of university project on implementing data mining techniques using R.  
* The presence of a full moon has been linked to unsavoury behaviour including crimes. For this project I decided to implement a Naive Bayes Classifier (NBC) on prediciting if it is a full moon based on crime characteristics.
* The data used was victim based crime records obtained from the Baltimore Police Department database which was joined to a full moon calendar.   
* A cluster analysis on crime characteristics was also performed using PAM clustering.     
*  The NBC was not successful as although it had a specificity of 1 it had a sensitivity of 0.  
* PAM clustering results can be seen in the visualisation below:
